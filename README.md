Empirical IO Problem Set 1

The ACA health insurance exchanges were established in every U.S. state in 2014 with the primary
aims of (1) reducing the number of people without health insurance in the U.S. and (2) making
health in- surance more affordable for those ineligible for employer-provided health insurance or
publicly-provided health insurance (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid). Exchange consumers can select
a plan from one of the four actuarial value (AV) or “metal” tiers: (1) bronze (which has a 60% AV);
(2) silver (70% AV); (3) gold (80% AV); and (4) platinum (90% AV) The actuarial value of a plan
refers to the expected percentage of health care expenditures that the insurer will pay. In addition
to plan AV, observable plan characteristics include whether the plan is a Health Maintenance
Organization (HMO) and the firm who sells the plan. Eligible consumers can receive subsidies for
purchasing a plan in the insurance exchanges. Consumers without insurance may be subject to a
penalty. The penalty amount was phased in between 2014 and 2016. Starting in 2019, the penalty
was eliminated.
You will be provided with a random sample of 2014-2019 enrollment data from the California
ACA health insurance exchange (called Covered California). The California exchange is divided
into 19 distinct rating areas which we will consider to be markets. Four large insurers – Anthem
Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Health Net, and Kaiser – participate in the California exchange. There are
also many small insurers, which have been combined for this analysis. In California (but not in most
other states), all insurers are required to offer a plan in each metal tier with predetermined cost
sharing levels (e.g., all silver plans have the same deductible, copays, coinsurance, etc.). Insurers
can differentiate plans based on provider network type (e.g., HMO or PPO) and which providers
are included in their networks.
